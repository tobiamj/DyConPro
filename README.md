# DyConPro
DYnamic CONnectivity PROcessing (DCP) toolbox.  

MATLAB tools for computation, manipulation and processing of single-subject and group dynamic functional connectivity (dfc) tensors and matrices.  It includes a function for computing a time-varying, instantaneous measure of functional connectivity (function dcp_dcs; see [Tobia et al., 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23821/full)) and numerous other functions to scale, binarize, transform to matrices, and analyze (e.g., neurocognitive network correlations, block GLMs) dfc tensors.

## Requirements
MATLAB version 2013b or higher.
